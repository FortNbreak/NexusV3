This source code will be published once we are done programming it. Please wait. We will not be publishing it to github.
We will be publishing it via zip. This is due to my Git Bash breaking and messing up when trying to push stuff to a repo.

This is made with WinUI 3 thanks to Microsoft.

Main languages:
- C#
- XAML

You will need Visual Studio 2022 to compile or dotnet 8 and build using ```dotnet build```
